1. First start by turning the house lights OFF if they are on using the buttons on the wall on either side of the room.

2. Next go into the lighting cloest and turn ON the top two dimmers EM1 and EM2 in addition to the 2 labeled Left and right (with green tape) by holding them in the up position till the Green LEDs are all the way up. This should          turn on a few on the house lights back on.

3. Next on the blue lighting board tap the button labeled BLACKOUT once to turn the lights on that are pointed at the ice rink.

4. Following that go over to the computer and turn up the sliders for the DIMMING and LINGING on the DMXcontroller_Motor Icon and the BRIGHTNESS on the DMXcontroller_RGBW icon.

5. Lastly power ON the snow lights with the Black remote labeled SNOW LIGHTS. Remember to turn the speed down using the S- button.

6. If the projector isnt already on power it on using the WHITE remote. The media player is on HDMI2 in the event the projector isnt set to that already.
