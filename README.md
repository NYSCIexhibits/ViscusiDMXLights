1. First start by turning the house lights OFF if they are on using the buttons on the wall on either side of the room.

2. Next go into the lighting closet and turn ON the top two dimmers EM1 and EM2 in addition to the 2 labeled Left and right (with green tape) by holding them in the up position till the Green LEDs are all the way up. This should          turn on a few of the house lights back on.

3. Following that go over to the computer and turn up the sliders for the BRIGHTNESS under the Moving Head Controls on the left to 1 and the BRIGHTNESS under the Surrounding RGBW Controls on the right to 1.

4. Next power ON the snow lights with the Black remote labeled SNOW LIGHTS. Remember to turn the speed down using the S- button.

5. If the projector isn't already on power it is using the WHITE remote. Use the iPad to play the video on the appleTV.

6. For snow fall from the snow machine, choose the correct day in the schedule dropdown (Friday, Weekend, Event) and the snow machine should produce snow for 3 min every 12min (3min of snow fall/12min no snow). 

**NOTE:** This is also coded to only operate during certain times of the day on the selected days. _Example:_ If it is a Tuesday at 11AM and you want snow, switch it to events and it should produce snow during the hours we are open (10-5).
